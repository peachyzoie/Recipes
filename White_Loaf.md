Fresh White Bread Loaf
Quantity : 1 Loaf

    - 1/4 tsp of Dry Active Yeast
    - 1/4 cup of warm water (to start with when activating the yeast)
    - 1 tsp of sugar
    - 2 cups of unbleached organic flour (I use King Arthur Organic Unbleached bread flour)
    - 1 tbsp of unsalted butter
    - A dash of salt
    - A splash of olive oil (for golden crust)

Directions

    - First, proof the yeast by mixing the yeast, water, and sugar together.
    - The yeast is alive when the mixture has a foam forming on top. If there is none after 5-10 minutes, the yeast is dead and you will need more.
    - After the yeast is proofed, mix in the flour while stirring. At the same time, slowly mix in salt, butter, and water 1/2 cup by 1/2 cup until a dough forms. There is no specified amount of water.
    - After a dough is formed, begin kneading by hand for about 7-10 minutes. TIP: It helps if you knead it on a flat surface with flour sprinkled on it to avoid sticking.
    - Then, place the dough in an oiled boil with a cover or silicone/plastic wrap. Let the dough rise for about an hour. If your kitchen is cold, place it in the oven turned off. TIP: Turn on the oven for a few minutes before you put the dough in to get it warm.
    - After it has risen, poke the rise and form the dough into the shape you want the bread to have.
    - Place the dough onto a baking sheet and put it into the turned off oven for 30-45 minutes.
    - When you can poke the dough lightly and there is an indent left that doesnt bounce back, its ready.
    - Place in the oven at 350 degrees and bake for 30 minutes!
    - Let it cool....
    - Eat!
