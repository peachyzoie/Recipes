# Zoies Apicius
These are my recipes, what better place to put them than on Github?

I love baking and cooking, and this is a nice place to store them on the cloud so to speak.

The Apicius is a Roman cookbook written by Caelius Apicius (supposedly) and is a collection of Roman recipes, probably written during the end of the empire.
